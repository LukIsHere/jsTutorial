//we talked earlier about functions
//javascript has many built in functions to help us with math
//all o them can be found inside Math namespace (read 2.1)
//some examples of them are

//round
Math.round(3.14)//3

//random - returns random number between 0.0 and 1.0
Math.random()
//Note: it means that if we do Math.round(Math.random()*10) we get random number between 0 and 10

//squer root
Math.sqrt(16)//4

//absolute valuse
Math.abs(-1)//1

//numver PI
Math.PI//3.141592653589793
//Note: it's not actully a function (just a variable)

//this functions might be usefull while performin
//more advance math operations
